Contributor License Agreement
=============================

A way to protect the community devs

Why?
====

A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is strongly recommended when accepting
third party contributions to an open development project, such as an open source
software project. In order to redistribute contributions, it is necessary to
ensure that the project has the necessary rights to do so.
A Contributor License Agreement is a lightweight agreement, signed by the
copyright holder, that grants the necessary rights for the contribution to be
redistributed as part of the project.

Contributor License Agreements also simplify the process of collaborating with
partners on projects as they can form part of a broader collaboration agreement.
Such agreements define ownership of copyright in works produced in collaboration
and, furthermore, they describe any licensing of specific copyright in materials
generated by the project.

`Read about it on Wikipedia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement>`_.

Who must sign the CLA's?
========================

The OCA wishes that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to the
OCA's projects complete, sign, and submit (via email) an `Individual Contributor
License Agreement (ICLA) PDF form <./ICLA.pdf>`_.
The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which
intellectual property has been contributed to the OCA and thereby allows us to
defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at
some future time. A signed CLA is required to be on file for every delegate
member and before an individual is given commit rights to an OCA project.

For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on an OCA project, an
`Entity CLA (or Corporate : CCLA) PDF form <./ECLA.pdf>`_ is available for
contributing intellectual property via the corporation, that may have been
assigned as part of an employment agreement.

Note that an Entity CLA does not remove the need for every developer to sign
their own CLA as an individual (ICLA), to cover any of their contributions which
are not owned by the corporation signing the Entity CLA (ECLA or CCLA).

How do I proceed?
=================

CLAs may be submitted by emailing a scan of the signed copy to cla AT
odoo-community.org.
**Please do not forget to give us your Github login!** Thanks!

The ICLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so it is recommended to use
your personal email address in the contact details, rather than your
professional one.

Your full name will be published. The email address and other contact details
will not be not published.

Find our `Individual <./ICLA.pdf>`_ and `Entity <./ECLA.pdf>`_ CLA's.

OCA Contributor Logo
====================

Signing the CLA allows you to use the official OCA Contributor logo on your
profile, resume or marketing materials.
However, you are not authorized to modify it.
