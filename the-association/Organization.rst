============
Introduction
============

**OCA is managed by Project Steering Committees (PSCs), comprised of committers
elected within a specific OCA project community to provide oversight for the
project for the OCA and to decide the release strategy for the project.**
PSC members are expected to act as individuals, making decisions for the best
interest of the project when acting on PSC or development lists.

**Each project's PSC is independent and responsible for a given scope, generally
a bunch of projects/repositories on github hosting various Odoo modules/Apps.**
An example is the `banking maintainers
<https://odoo-community.org/project/banking-maintainers-10>`_, reponsible for a
set of `project/Github repositories
<https://github.com/orgs/OCA/teams/banking-maintainers/repositories>`_, each of
them `hosting various modules/Apps
<https://github.com/OCA/bank-statement-reconcile>`_.

PSCs are free to set community and technical direction for their project, and
are directly responsible for overseeing releases and the healthy development of
their communities.

PSCs are responsible for ensuring their project follows certain core
requirements set by the board, like following Legal, conventions, and
Infrastructure related requirements, along with ensuring their community
operates within the basic outline of the OCA Way.

PSC members nominate new contributors to the project, and PSC members cast votes
on electing PSC members to the project. PSC members also have binding votes on
any project matters.

=============
Communication
=============

PSC members should always be subscribed to their project's `public list
<https://odoo-community.org/groups>`_, and to at least the contributors@ list to
be aware of the other collaboration and contributions.
Virtually all PSC communication should happen on the project’s public list.

**Ensuring that PSC discussions about the future of the project are held on the
public lists ensures that all of the community - including non-members - can
follow the discussion and comment on issues.**
While only PSC members have binding votes on project matters, healthy PSCs
certainly work with the larger community of their project.

=====
Merit
=====

Ensuring that PSC members are helping to mentor helpful new contributors to
their projects helps to ensure a healthy and growing project community.

** PSCs are free to set the bar for merit within their projects, as long as
decision making is done in a collaborative fashion as in the OCA Way.
Healthy PSCs will regularly review contributions from non-committers - both
specific code patches, bugs reported or commented on, or just helpful
interaction on their project lists - to evaluate contributors as potential
committers.**
PSCs are solely responsible for managing votes and granting commit
privileges for new committers; however new PSC members elected must always
signed the OCA CLA.

Merit within one PSC is not transferable to other PSCs; each project's committer
list is independently managed by its own PSC. There are many PSCs who work
closely with other PSCs, and have correspondingly large intersection in
personnel; but the merit on each PSC is independent.

Although the plain sense of the word "committer" is "someone who can create new
revisions in the source repository", the notion of "committership" is a social
one—someone is a committer if they have been invited by the PSC to be a
committer, and have accepted the invitation.

=========
Community
=========

While only PSC members have binding votes on project releases, in general PSC
members participate equally with their project committers and contributors on
the contributors@ list. PSC members can help to ensure a healthy and diverse
project community by ensuring the project's mailing lists are welcoming
newcomers and that community standards are promoted on its mailing lists.

**While there are many projects with overlapping communities - and therefore some
shared personal or technical relationships - fundamentally each project is its
own community in terms of the bulk of project work.**

PSCs are expected to report on the health and diversity of their project's
community to the board. While there are no strict requirements on the makeup of
PSC members (in terms of employment or affiliation of the individuals on the
PSC), the board does expect PSCs to operate independently of outside commercial
influence. PSCs that are unable or unwilling to ensure their actions are on
behalf of the whole community - or act in ways targeted to specific commercial
interests - will be contacted by the board and required to make corrections.

====================================
Project Management and Collaboration
====================================

The OCA projects are managed using a collaborative, consensus-based process.
**We do not have a hierarchical structure. Rather, different groups of
contributors have different rights and responsibilities in the organization.**

Since the appointed PSC have the power to create their own self-governing rules,
there is no single vision on how PSCs should run a project and the communities
they host.

At the same time, while there are some differences, there are a number of
similarities shared by all the projects:

Communication
=============

Communication is done via mailing lists. These identify "virtual meeting rooms"
where conversations happen asynchronously, which is a general requirement for
groups that are so geographically distributed to cover all time zones.

Some projects additionally use more synchronous messaging (for example, IRC or
instant messaging). Voice communication is extremely rare, normally because of
costs and the language barrier (speech is harder to understand than written
text).

In general, asynchronous communication is much more important because it allows
archives to be created and it's more tolerant on the volunteer nature of the
various communities.

Documentation
=============

Each project is responsible for its own project website (e.g.
`connector-magento
<https://odoo-community.org/project/connector-magento-maintainers-38>`_),
Github page (e.g. `maintainer-tools <https://github.com/OCA/maintainer-tools>`_)
and Apps description on `Odoo Apps store <https://www.odoo.com/apps>`_ and
should comply with OCA Conventions and infrastructure services.

Decision Making
===============

**Projects are normally auto governing and driven by the people who volunteer
for the job. This is sometimes referred to as "do-ocracy" -- power of those who
do.**
This functions well for most cases. When coordination is required, decisions are
taken with a lazy consensus approach: a few positive votes with no negative vote
is enough to get going.

Voting is done with numbers:

* +1 -- a positive vote
* 0 -- abstain, have no opinion
* -1 -- a negative vote

The rules require that a negative vote includes an alternative proposal or a
detailed explanation of the reasons for the negative vote.

The community then tries to gather consensus on an alternative proposal that
resolves the issue. In the great majority of cases, the concerns leading to the
negative vote can be addressed.

This process is called "consensus gathering" and we consider it a very important
indication of a healthy community.

You can learn more on the following `Apache Foundation page: detailed voting
rules <https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html>`_.

Philosophy
==========

While there is not an official list, **these six principles have been cited as
the core beliefs of philosophy behind the association**, which is normally
referred to as "The OCA Way":

* Collaborative software development
* Commercial-friendly standard license
* Consistently high quality software
* Respectful and honest interaction
* Faithful implementation of standards

All of the OCA projects share these principles.

Operation
=========

**All projects are composed of volunteers and nobody (not even members or
officers) are paid directly by the association for their job.**
There are many examples of committers that are paid to work on the projects, but
never by the association themselves, but rather by companies or institutions
that use the software and want to enhance it or maintain it.
The OCA may promote crowdfunding campaign made by contributors to finance some
developments.
In that case, the campaign will have clear objectives and the financed people
will be known in advance.

Note that the OCA does contract out various services, including administratives
tasks, accounting, press, media relations, and infrastructure.

Individuals compose the OCA
===========================

All of the OCA including the board, the other officers, the committers, and the
members, are participating as individuals. That is one strength of the OCA,
affiliations do not cloud the personal contributions.

Unless they specifically state otherwise, whatever they post on any mailing list
is done as themselves. It is the individual point-of-view, wearing their
personal hat and not as a mouthpiece for whatever company happens to be signing
their paychecks right now.

All of those OCA people implicitly have multiple hats, especially the Board, the
other officers, and the OCA representative. They sometimes need to talk about a
matter of policy, so to avoid appearing to be expressing a personal opinion,
they will state that they are talking in their special capacity. However, most
of the time this is not necessary, personal opinions work well.

====
Role
====

Contributor
===========

**A contributor is anyone who wants to contribute (code, documentation, tests,
ideas, anything!) to any OCA project hosted here at the Odoo Community
Association (OCA).**
He's generally subscribed to the contributors@ mailing list.

Note: if you are interested in contributing financially, please see `the
sponsorship program page <https://odoo-community.org/page/become-a-sponsor>`_.

PSC Member
==========

**A PSC member is someone that was elected due to merit for the evolution of the
project and demonstration of commitment.**
They have write access to the code repository, the right to vote for the
project-related decisions and the right to propose an active user for
committership.
The PSC as a whole is the entity that controls the project, nobody else.
It is not required to be a member of the association to be part of a PSC.

OCA Representative
==================

**The OCA representative is appointed by the Board from the PSC Members.**
The PSC as a whole is the entity that controls and leads the project.
The OCA Representative is the interface between the Board and the Project.
OCA Representative have specific duties.
