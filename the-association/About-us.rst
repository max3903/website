The Odoo Community Association, or OCA, is a nonprofit organization whose
mission is to support the collaborative development of the Odoo features and to
promote the widespread use of Odoo. The Association provides financial,
organizational and legal support to the broader Odoo Open Source community.
It also serves as an independent legal entity to which community members can
contribute to the code, the funding and other resources, with the knowledge
that their contributions will be maintained for public benefit.

**The Association’s projects are all freely available and usable under an
OSI-certified Open Source license.**
